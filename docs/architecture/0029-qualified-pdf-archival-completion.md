# ADR 0029: Qualified PDF archival completion

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

The qualified-PDF coordinator in ADR 0017 originally consumed the locally
verified card signature immediately to produce PAdES-B-B. The timestamp,
validation-material, DSS, and document-timestamp components were subsequently
implemented as separate strict layers. Product orchestration now needs to join
them without retaining the card session across network work or weakening any
ownership boundary.

Timestamp and revocation requests are synchronous at the protocol boundary but
must never run on the Android UI thread. Live authority selection, offline
trust, retry, cancellation, and product exposure are separate configuration
decisions.

## Decision

Qualified card signing may now return a one-use
`PreparedQualifiedPdfSignature`. It owns the prepared PDF placeholder, exact
signed attributes, locally verified card signature, and qualified signer
certificate. The existing baseline-signing entry point remains compatible by
immediately consuming this capability as PAdES-B-B.

`QualifiedPdfArchivalCompletion` consumes the capability synchronously in this
fixed order:

1. copy the qualified signer certificate and derive SHA-384 over the stored CMS
   signature value;
2. acquire a verified RFC 3161 token for that exact signature digest;
3. assemble the timestamped CMS and fill the prepared PDF as PAdES-B-T;
4. collect authenticated signer and TSA validation material using the signer
   certificate and signature timestamp;
5. append that material as a DSS and prepare the whole-document timestamp
   revision;
6. acquire a verified RFC 3161 token for the exact archive digest; and
7. complete the document timestamp and return the owned PAdES-B-LTA document.

Timestamp and validation access are injected through narrow source interfaces.
Both digests and the signer-certificate input are borrowed. Verified timestamp
tokens and validation material transfer to the orchestrator. Each returned
timestamp is checked again against the requested digest before use.

All intermediate owners close on every result. Digest, certificate, signed
attribute, card-signature, CMS, timestamp-token, validation-material, and
intermediate-PDF buffers are cleared where the runtime permits. Only the final
`SignedPdfDocument` transfers to a successful caller. Failures preserve the
timestamp phase and typed CMS, PDF, and validation-path causes, while source
availability and unexpected failures remain coarse and retain no network
address, response, credential, or throwable.

Debug builds trace only stage names, duration, public document length, and
typed outcome. The release trace sink remains empty and release bytecode is
checked after shrinking.

## Verification

Framework-free unit tests prove the exact phase order, both requested digest
lifetimes, DSS-before-document-timestamp ordering, successful PDF parsing,
one-use completion, and clearing of all observable owners. They exercise
unavailable and wrong-imprint tokens independently at the signature and
archive phases, typed validation failure, coarse validation-source failure,
and timestamped-CMS failure. Existing cryptographic interoperability tests
continue to independently validate the lower-level PAdES-B-T and PAdES-B-LTA
output with OpenSSL, qpdf, and Poppler.

No live authority, card identity, credential, certificate, document, or
network identifier is used by these tests or stored in the repository.

## Consequences

The document layer now has a complete injected PAdES-B-LTA product sequence,
and the card-owned material no longer needs to survive as loose byte arrays.
The sequence is deliberately not reachable from product UI yet. Shipping still
requires approved signer and TSA trust configuration, retry and cancellation
policy, debug-only off-main integration, and a clear Android policy for any
authenticated HTTP certificate endpoints.
